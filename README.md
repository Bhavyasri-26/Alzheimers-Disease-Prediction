# Alzheimers-Disease-Prediction
The main objective is to detect the early stages of Alzheimer's in a range of people.So, we use CDR and SMMSE tests online before moving on to MRI or CT scans, and then follow them up with machine learning algorithms to evaluate the data along with test results. With the aid of these tests, it will be possible to identify Alzheimer's disease in its early stages. An MLframework can help resolve this issue by diagnosing the disorder. The outcomes and analysis of various machine learning models for dementia diagnosis are presented in this work. A variety of methods have been used to find the most accurate parameters for Alzheimer's disease prediction, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K Nearest Neighbor classifiers. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data is used to generate predictions for Alzheimer's disease, and the performance of ML models is gauged using metrics including Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score. Despite the dataset's limited size, some important numbers are included. Two machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. Following system development, findings demonstrate that SVM performs better than other models.
